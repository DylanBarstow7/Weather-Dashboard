## Description
This assignment was to create a weather dashboard that allows the creator to search for a 5 day weather forecast for any major city. When a city is input into the search bar the current weather and 5 day forecast are displayed on screen. This forecast includes City Name, Date, Humidity, Wind Speed, Icon describing the current weather, and a UV Index. The UV Index background text color will adjust based on the value in UV Index. Once a city is input they will be displayed in a column where you may go back to view past searches or clear your search history.
